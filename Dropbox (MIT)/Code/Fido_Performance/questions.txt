1. Why skip scoring and sorting of loans?

2. Proucer consumer logic is good. Maybe can be improved. It might be a bit overkill.

3. New loan logic. Just based on counts. How does that work?

4. Only filter?

5. How often is it that at a new loan listing time we only get a percentage of the loans?

6. Bug for buying 100% might be from two buying pieces in the code.
  - not setting the buy value correctly
  - cirrix1

7. How is the code run when you are going to start buying?

8. Why is Cirrix1 different?
