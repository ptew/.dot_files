12/23/15 - 1 hour  - Looked through code. Discussed code and project with Jonathan

12/25/15 - 3 hours - Setup project such that it could be run. 
                   - Looked through code and changed it so it could be run safely.
                   - Built logger that logged loans to csv file.
                   - Next step is to finalize logging implementation and build benchmark
                   - Want to test out JSON vs. CSV
                   - Look into overhead of multithreading for Java
                  
12/25/15 - 2 hours - Refactored code.
                   - Got timing results. CSV is about 30 percent faster for parsing.
                      - ~60 ms vs ~90 ms for JSON
                   - Tried speeding up requests by offloading URI creation to constructor

01/04/16 - 2 hours - Looked over LoanRetriever and LoanOrderer in detail
                   - Looked over logs to look at areas of improvement
                   - Designed new system to combine LoanRetriever and LoanOrdered to reduce order latency

01/06/16 - 2 hours - Researched Cirrix1 vs non-Cirix1 differences 
                   - Meeting with Jonathan
                   - TODO:
                        - Remove Consumer/Producer from Cirrix1
                        - Look for bug in Cirrix1 with wrong buy percentage
                        - Investigate JSON vs CSV networking timing differences
                        - Build custom JSON or CSV parser depending on which is faster
                        - Build Multiple Retriever / One Orderer type system
                            - Use Buffered Queue for one version
                            - Use vanilla array with synchronized flag for another
