12/23/15 - 1 hour  - Looked through code. Discussed code and project with Jonathan

12/25/15 - 3 hours - Setup project such that it could be run. 
                   - Looked through code and changed it so it could be run safely.
                   - Built logger that logged loans to csv file.
                   - Next step is to finalize logging implementation and build benchmark
                   - Want to test out JSON vs. CSV
                   - Look into overhead of multithreading for Java
                  
12/25/15 - 2 hours - Refactored code.
                   - Got timing results. CSV is about 30 percent faster for parsing.
                      - ~60 ms vs ~90 ms for JSON
                   - Tried speeding up requests by offloading URI creation to constructor

01/04/16 - 2 hours - Looked over LoanRetriever and LoanOrderer in detail
                   - Looked over logs to look at areas of improvement
                   - Designed new system to combine LoanRetriever and LoanOrdered to reduce order latency

01/06/16 - 2 hours - Researched Cirrix1 vs non-Cirix1 differences 
                   - Meeting with Jonathan
                   - TODO:
                        - Remove Consumer/Producer from Cirrix1
                        - Look for bug in Cirrix1 with wrong buy percentage
                        - Investigate JSON vs CSV networking timing differences
                        - Build custom JSON or CSV parser depending on which is faster
                        - Build Multiple Retriever / One Orderer type system
                            - Use Buffered Queue for one version
                            - Use vanilla array with synchronized flag for another
                       
01/07/16 - 2 hours - Discovered unused boolean showAll for getLoanAsString
                   - Do you ever want to buy partial/Can you buy partial of a non Cirrix1 loan?
                        - Should change setRequestAmounts to be more specialized
                        - It is in the hot zone and should be as fast as possible
                   - Is the bulk of buying just in one go?
                   - Might want to make LoanList more low level
                   - Made content timing script and sent results to Jonathan
                        - CSV winner.
                        - Now will move on to building low level parser for CSV

01/08/16 - 1 hour - Java vs Curl experiment
                       - Java code proved to be slightly faster over 50 trials
                       - Emailed results to Jonathan
